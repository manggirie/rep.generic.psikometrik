<p>Assuming that you have a form named &quot;Employee Details Form&quot;. In that form there are section that employee has to fill in their emergency contacts. It could be more than 1 record. So how can you setup your application to store these value?</p>
<p>In this example, at <code>Schema Designer</code>  we add <em>EmergencyContactCollection</em> in <em>Employee</em> entity. This child item must be of type <code>Collection</code> and the name must be appended with &quot;<em>Collection</em>&quot; . </p>
